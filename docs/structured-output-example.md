### Structured Output
This example shows how to get structured output objects using the StructureOutputAgent class.
```python

# Example that uses the StructuredOutputAgent class to create a dataset entry of a book, out of unstructured data.

from enum import Enum
from typing import List

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from llama_cpp_agent import MessagesFormatterType
from llama_cpp_agent import StructuredOutputAgent
from llama_cpp_agent.providers import TGIServerProvider

model = TGIServerProvider("http://localhost:8080")


# Example enum for our output model
class Category(Enum):
    Fiction = "Fiction"
    NonFiction = "Non-Fiction"


# Example output model
class Book(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents an entry about a book.
    """

    title: str = Field(..., description="Title of the book.")
    author: str = Field(..., description="Author of the book.")
    published_year: int = Field(..., description="Publishing year of the book.")
    keywords: List[str] = Field(..., description="A list of keywords.")
    category: Category = Field(..., description="Category of the book.")
    summary: str = Field(..., description="Summary of the book.")


structured_output_agent = StructuredOutputAgent(
    model, debug_output=True,
    messages_formatter_type=MessagesFormatterType.CHATML
)
