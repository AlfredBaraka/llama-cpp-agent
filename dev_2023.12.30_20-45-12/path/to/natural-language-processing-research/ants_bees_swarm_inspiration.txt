## Swarm Behavior Inspired System Architecture
1. Agent Initialization
   - Spawn multiple Large Language Model Agents (LLMAs) with unique IDs.
2. Message Passing
   - Each LLMA receives information about the task and context from a central hub.
3. Task Decomposition
   - Break down the overall task into smaller subtasks.
4. Load Balancing
   - Distribute subtasks among LLMAs based on their expertise and availability.
5. Collaborative Learning
   - Encourage knowledge sharing between LLMAs during task execution.
6. Feedback Mechanism
   - Monitor performance and provide feedback to improve future collaboration.
7. Adaptation
   - Allow LLMAs to adapt their strategies based on performance feedback.
8. Self-Organization
   - Enable LLMAs to form clusters or teams based on similarity in skills or interests.
9. Swarm Decision Making
   - Reach consensus among LLMA clusters for complex decisions.
