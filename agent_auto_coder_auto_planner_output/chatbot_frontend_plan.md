# Development Plan for Dark Theme Chat Bot Frontend

## Project Overview
This development plan outlines the steps required to create a chat bot frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a dark theme.

## Deliverables
1. **HTML Structure**: Create the basic structure of the webpage using HTML tags and elements.
2. **CSS Styling**: Implement the dark theme styling using CSS, including typography, color schemes, and layout.
3. **JavaScript Interactivity**: Add interactivity to the chat bot frontend using JavaScript, such as handling user input and updating the conversation.
4. **Final Testing and Deployment**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure proper functionality and deploy the project.
