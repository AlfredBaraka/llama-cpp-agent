# Dark Theme Chat Bot Frontend Project

This is a simple chat bot frontend developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a dark theme and allows users to interact with the chat bot by typing messages in an input field. The chat bot responds with predefined messages from an array of responses.

## Development Plan
The development plan outlines the steps required to create this chat bot frontend, including:
1. Setting up the HTML structure
2. Styling the interface with a dark theme using CSS
3. Adding interactivity with JavaScript
4. Final testing and deployment

Please refer to the `./chatbot_frontend_plan.md` file for more detailed information about the development process.

## Technologies Used

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Challenges & Considerations
During development, some challenges were encountered, such as:

- Ensuring proper responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices
- Optimizing performance for better user experience
- Meeting accessibility requirements

These aspects have been addressed according to the development plan.

## Future Enhancements
This chat bot frontend can be enhanced further by:

- Integrating it with a backend API for dynamic responses
- Improving the chat bot's response generation algorithm
- Adding more advanced features like voice interaction or sentiment analysis

## Completion Criteria
For this project to be marked as complete, the following criteria need to be fulfilled:

1. Functional Chat Bot Frontend: Users should be able to interact with the chat bot through input fields and receive appropriate responses.
2. Dark Theme Implementation: The dark theme should be visually appealing and consistent across all UI elements.
3. Code Quality: Industry best practices should be followed, and the codebase should be well-documented.
4. Accessibility: Minimum accessibility standards should be met, enabling users with disabilities to navigate and use the application effectively.
5. Version Control: All code changes should be committed to a version control system (e.g., Git) and pushed to a remote repository.
6. Testing: The chat bot frontend should be thoroughly tested under various conditions and edge cases.
7. Deployment: The chat bot frontend should be deployed on an appropriate hosting platform, accessible via a public URL.

Once these criteria are met, the project will be considered complete. Good luck with your implementation!
