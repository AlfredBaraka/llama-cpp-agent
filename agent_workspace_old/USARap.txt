Verse 1
The drug problem in the USA, it's a real pain
People suffer, it's a never-ending chain
From the streets to the highways, the crisis is wide
Addiction takes lives, it's a terrible ride

Chorus
Drugs take control, they don't let go
They ruin lives, that's where they grow
It's a battle we face, a never-ending fight
We need a change, the situation's not right

Verse 2
From prescription meds to street drugs like coke
The addiction epidemic, it's a devastating yoke
It doesn't discriminate, young or old
Affects us all, it's a heavy toll

Chorus
Drugs take control, they don't let go
They ruin lives, that's where they grow
It's a battle we face, a never-ending fight
We need a change, the situation's not right

Bridge
We gotta stand together, we can't let it win
We gotta help each other, we need to begin
Education and treatment, it's the only way
To beat this monster, it's our only play

Chorus
Drugs take control, they don't let go
They ruin lives, that's where they grow
It's a battle we face, a never-ending fight
We need a change, the situation's not right

Outro
It's time to break the cycle, it's time to heal
Let's fight this battle, it's real
We've got the power, we're not alone
Let's end this war, it's time to go home
