In the land of the free and the home of the brave,
A nation born in struggle, with dreams to pave,
From sea to shining sea, a grand expanse,
A melting pot of cultures, a chance to advance.

The rolling hills of Virginia, the majestic Rockies,
The Grand Canyon and Yosemite, both so pretty,
The golden coast of California, the lush woods of Maine,
A beauty that spans from sea to sea, in every state, a scene.

A history that began with the Pilgrims, the settlers of old,
Strong-willed and determined, to seek out the gold,
From the War of Independence, to the Civil War,
A tale of unity, and a story that we all explore.

A nation built on freedom, opportunity, and hope,
A promise to all who come, a chance to cope,
With the challenges that life throws, the good and the bad,
A land that stands strong, a beacon, a symbol, a fad.

A nation that grows with every new face,
A nation that learns, a nation that embraces,
The differences that make us unique, the strengths that we hold,
A nation that stands tall, a nation that we can behold.

In the land of the free, and the home of the brave,
A nation that unites, and a story we crave,
A land that is strong, a land that we call our own,
A land that we cherish, a land that we call home.
