In the land of the free, where dreams take flight,
The United States of America stands tall and bright.
From the mighty Pacific to the Atlantic's shore,
This nation's beauty leaves us in awe forevermore.

From the Statue of Liberty's torch that gleams,
To the Grand Canyon's depths that reach the skies with dreams.
America, with its diverse culture and lands,
Holds the spirit of freedom and strength in its hands.

From the bustling cities to the open plains,
This nation's beauty never goes in vain.
The music, the food, and the people we adore,
Make America a place like no other evermore.

The USA, with its history and strength so grand,
Is a beacon of hope for all to understand.
May we always cherish and protect this land,
And continue to make it great, hand in hand.
