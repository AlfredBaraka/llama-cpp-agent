# SECTION: poem
In the land of the free and the home of the brave,
A nation that stands tall, proud and brave.
From sea to shining sea, a land of opportunity,
A melting pot of dreams, a land of liberty.

From the rugged mountains to the golden plains,
A land of diverse beauty, a land of gains.
A nation built on values, a beacon of hope,
A land that inspires, a land that does cope.

From the founding fathers to the modern age,
A nation that has faced many a rage.
But through it all, a nation has stood tall,
A land that has weathered many a storm, a land that does enthrall.

A land of innovation, a land of dreams,
A land that has conquered many a scheme.
A land that has given so much to the world,
A land that has changed the course, a land that does unfurl.

Oh, land that I love, a land that is free,
A land that has been, and will always be.
A land that I am proud to call my own,
A land that I will cherish, a land that does grow.# END SECTION
