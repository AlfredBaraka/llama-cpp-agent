In the land of the free and the home of the brave,
A tale of two coasts, with a heart that's so brave.
From sea to shining sea, a melody of dreams,
A nation united, by a river's gleaming streams.

Beneath the eagle's wing, a flag of stars above,
A diverse melting pot, where hope and love do rove.
From the mountains to the prairies, the cities and the towns,
A symphony of voices, from every single sound.

The mighty Mississippi, the Hudson, the Potomac too,
Each river a story, a history that's true.
The Grand Canyon, the Rockies, the deserts and the plains,
Each landscape a treasure, in this land of gains.

From the bustling streets of New York, to the beaches of LA,
A nation of dreams, where the future will sway.
With freedom as our guide, we'll walk this great land,
Hand in hand, a journey that will never wane.
