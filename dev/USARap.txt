Verse 1
The drug problem in the USA, it's a real disgrace
Kids on the street, in the shadows of the state
Painkillers, opioids, meth, and coke
The cycle of addiction, it's a never-ending joke
Chorus
Drug problem, it's a plague
In this land of the free, it's a dangerous game
We need to rise up, break the chains
End the drug crisis, let the healing begin
Verse 2
The war on drugs, it's a mess
The government's plan, it's a stress
Kids in the system, lives in ruins
A nation's youth, the future, it's been ruined
Chorus
Drug problem, it's a plague
In this land of the free, it's a dangerous game
We need to rise up, break the chains
End the drug crisis, let the healing begin
Bridge
It's time to change, it's time to heal
The drug problem, it's a threat, it's real
We're stronger together, we'll stand up and fight
For a future where addiction's a thing of the past
Chorus
Drug problem, it's a plague
In this land of the free, it's a dangerous game
We need to rise up, break the chains
End the drug crisis, let the healing begin
